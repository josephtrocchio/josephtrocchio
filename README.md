# Hello!!
My name is Joseoh Trocchio and I'm currently the HEAD of Academy Performance for the Philadlephia Union

## My Mission
My goal is to optimize performance, mitigate injury, and hold the ability to recondition athletes back to athletic normal. I aim to achieve this goal through a fundemental heuristic approach to strength and conditioning, an athlete centered reconditioning model, and the integration of computing machines to automate and ease workflow.

## My focus on github
- Continue to learn 21st century skill sets
- Implement the industry standard VCS for my projects
- collaborate with others to improve code bases

## Technologies I'm passionate about

- Linux (Mint) :computer:

- Docker :whale:
- Pandas :panda_face:
